  <title>Grails Font Awesome Resources Plugin</title>
  <description>Like the jquery-resources plugin that pulls in the jquery javascript lib as a resource, this plugin pulls in Font Awesome. 
Font Awesome is a very popular font based icon set. Font based icons are a very convenient means of incorporating icons into a web application and the technique is growing in popularity. 
Font Awesome probably works best when used with the twitter bootstrap UI framework for which it was designed.
From version 4.0.3.0 support for IE7 is gone, since Font Awesome does not support IE7 any longer.
