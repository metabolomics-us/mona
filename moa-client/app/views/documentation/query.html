            <h4>General query format</h4>


            The general query format is a simple JSON object describing the wished object. You could call it query by
            examples. For example the query bellow will be interpredted the folloing way:

            <ol>
                <li>Select all compounds, which have metadata objects containing a molecule formula (name) identical
                    (eq) to C47H74O12S
                </li>

                <li>than limit it to spectra, who have a metadata object compoundclass (name) with a value identical
                    (eq) to SQDG
                </li>
                <li>than limit these spectra to all spectra, which are tagged (tags) with the values 'virtual' and
                    'lipidblast'
                </li>
            </ol>
            <pre>
                {
                    "compound": {
                        "metadata": [
                            {
                                "name": "molecule formula",
                                "value": {
                                    "eq": "C47H74O12S"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    },

                    "metadata": [
                        {
                            "name": "compoundclass",
                            "value": {
                                "eq": "SQDG"
                            }
                        }
                    ],

                    "tags": [
                        "virtual",
                        "lipidblast"
                    ]
                }
            </pre>

            The return will be a list of spectra object, which all there associated values. You can execute this query
            utilizing the software curl the following way

            <p>
                <samp>
                    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"compound":{"metadata":[{"name":"molecule
                    formula","value":{"eq":"C47H74O12S"}}]},"metadata":[{"name":"compoundclass","value":{"eq":"SQDG"}}],"tags":["virtual","lipidblast"],"offset":0}'
                    http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/rest/spectra/search
                </samp>

            </p>

            In case you like to receive your result directly as MSP data file, you can specify the format in the query.

            The new query would than look like

                        <pre>
                {
                    "compound": {
                        "metadata": [
                            {
                                "name": "molecule formula",
                                "value": {
                                    "eq": "C47H74O12S"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    },

                    "metadata": [
                        {
                            "name": "compoundclass",
                            "value": {
                                "eq": "SQDG"
                            }
                        }
                    ],

                    "tags": [
                        "virtual",
                        "lipidblast"
                    ],

                    "format" : "msp"
                }
            </pre>

            and can be again invoked like this

            <p>
                <samp>
                    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"compound":{"metadata":[{"name":"molecule
                    formula","value":{"eq":"C47H74O12S"}}]},"metadata":[{"name":"compoundclass","value":{"eq":"SQDG"}}],"tags":["virtual","lipidblast"],"offset":0,"format":"msp"}'
                    http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/rest/spectra/search
                </samp>

            </p>

            <h4>Query</h4>

            <p>
                The mona database system utilizes an internal id, which should generally not be queried or utilized.
                This is the numeric id, you see in the top of your browser sometimes. Instead
                it's always better to utilize the mona-key, which is an unique hash code. Think about it like an
                InChI-Key for spectra, which can be easily utilized to test if two spectra are identical.

            </p>

            <h5>
                An example query to get all spectra, associated with a given id would be:
            </h5>
            <pre>
                {
                    "id":["mona-00d6aa5242967963fb9f34005b1ff071"]
                }
            </pre>

            Which would return any spectrum with the exact same hashcode.

            Currently can receive more than just one result with this, since we do allow duplicate submission of spectra
            to the system. These duplicates will automatically removed during validation and curration tasks of the
            system.

        <div>

            <h4>Deletes</h4>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Updates</h4>

            <p>
                To run updates against the system, you can utilize the same approach as running queries. But currently the update is very limited to added or removing tags.

                <h5>
                    An example to add a tag for a number of specified spectra ids
                </h5>

                <pre>

                    {
                        query:

                        {
                            id:
                                [
                                    {
                                        value:
                                            {
                                                in: [199]
                                            }
                                    }
                                ]
                        }

                        update:

                        {
                            tags :
                                [
                                    'addMyTag',
                                    '-removeMyTag'
                                ]
                        }
                    }
                </pre>
