    <h3>Welcome to MoNa</h3>

    <p>
        MassBank of America (MoNa), is an auto curating repository for storing, comparing and querying mass spectra of
        chemical compounds.

        It is metadata centric and it was designed to allow easy integration into other tools by utilize its REST based
        application programming interface.

    </p>

    <p>
        At the current time it contains over 200k predicted and 40k unique experimental mass spectra and their
        associated
        metadata. The predicted spectra were obtained by utilizing the lipid blast library and the experimental spectra
        were
        acquired from 30 different facilities all over the world, including several major research facilities in the
        United
        States and Japan.
    </p>

    <p>
        MoNa is utilizing the InChI Key as unique identifier for chemicals and is designed for easy scalability and
        expendability. This is realized by utilizing common applications like nginx, grails, AngularJS, postgresSQL and
        tomcat.

    </p>
    MoNa is currently integrated in applications like MSDial, BinBase, MZMine and the statistics package R. This was
    accomplished by utilizing its REST based API, which is also utilized by its main AngularJS based web interface.
    We consider MoNa to be highly useful for crosslinking mass spectra in publications, identification of unknowns and
    integration in data acquisition software.
