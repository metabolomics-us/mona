            <h2>Welcome to MoNA!</h2>

            <p>
                MassBank of North America (MoNA) is a metadata-centric, auto-curating repository designed for efficient storage and querying of mass spectral records.
                It intends to serve as a the framework for a centralized, collaborative database of metabolite mass spectra, metadata and associated compounds.
                MoNA currently contains over 200,000 mass spectral records from experimental and in-silico libraries as well as from user contributions.
            </p>

            <p>
                MoNA has recently been redesigned, with significant improvements to server-side architecture, query structure, and search speed.
                We are actively improving and adding features, so please be patient as functionality is added.
                If you notice any major issues, feel free to report them using the issue tracker linked below.

                    The spectrum browser has been updated with improved panel and table views.
                    The infinite scroll has been replaced with pagination to make browsing spectra easier,
                    the panel view now displays the most valuable metadata first, and the table view has fully
                    customizable columns.
