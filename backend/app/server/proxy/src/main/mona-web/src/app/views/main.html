            <h2>Welcome to MoNA!</h2>

            <p>
                MassBank of North America (MoNA) is a metadata-centric, auto-curating repository designed for efficient storage and querying of mass spectral records.
                It intends to serve as a the framework for a centralized, collaborative database of metabolite mass spectra, metadata and associated compounds.
                MoNA currently contains over 200,000 mass spectral records from experimental and in-silico libraries as well as from user contributions.
            </p>

            <p>
                MoNA has recently been redesigned, with significant improvements to server-side architecture, query structure, and search speed.
                We are actively improving and adding features, so please be patient as functionality is added.
                If you notice any major issues, feel free to report them using the issue tracker linked below.

                MoNA has undergone a technological update to use the Angular 10 framework.
                Included in the update is an overhaul of the Advanced Uploader system to handle
                large file uploads as well as a straight through processing system for anything
                over 10 MB. Various bugfixes have been included to help improve usability for
                our users. We will continue working to improve MoNA with new features and
                bugfixes. Checkout the <a href="https://wcmc.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues?q=mona">YouTrack</a>
