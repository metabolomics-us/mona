                MassBank of North America (MoNA) is a metadata-centric, auto-curating repository designed for efficient storage and querying of mass spectral records.
                It intends to serve as a the framework for a centralized, collaborative database of metabolite mass spectra, metadata, and associated compounds.
                MoNA currently contains {{totalCount | number:'1.0-0'}} mass spectral records from experimental and in-silico libraries, as well as user contributions.

                MoNA has undergone substantial changes to its backend services. Frontend features work as they did before with an exception of
                the RSQL query system which has been changed to the <a [routerLink]="['/documentation/query']">Spring Filtering system</a>.

                A new feature has been introduced that allows signed in users to delete spectra that matches their submitter ID. This feature
                is embedded into the spectra browser where you will see a new "My Submitted Spectra" button that can query for your spectra, as
                well as a "Mark for Deletion" checkbox around your submitted spectra. Once selected, just hit the "Batch Delete" button and remove
                spectra that needs to be removed.
