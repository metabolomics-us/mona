            <p>
                MassBank of North America (MoNA) is a metadata-centric, auto-curating repository designed for efficient storage and querying of mass spectral records.
                It intends to serve as a the framework for a centralized, collaborative database of metabolite mass spectra, metadata and associated compounds.
                MoNA currently contains {{totalCount}} mass spectral records from experimental and in-silico libraries as well as from user contributions.
            </p>

            <p>
                MoNA has recently been redesigned, with significant improvements to server-side architecture, query structure, and search speed.
                We are actively improving and adding features, so please be patient as functionality is added.
                If you notice any major issues, feel free to report them using the issue tracker linked below.

                The search page has been enhanced! Users can now easily search the countless metaData in MoNA. Click the <em>Search Spectra</em> button
                above to see the new feature. Additionally, users should be able to query for SMILES, InChI, and InChIKey more easily then before
                in the <em>Compound MetaData</em> section of the new search page.

                A new feature has been introduced that allows signed in users to delete spectra that matches their submitter ID. This feature
                is embedded into the spectra browser where you will see a new "My Submitted Spectra" button that can query for your spectra, as
                well as a "Mark for Deletion" checkbox around your submitted spectra. Once selected, just hit the "Batch Delete" button and remove
                spectra that needs to be removed.

                The spectrum feedback feature has been enhanced to allow users to rate spectrum and see community feedback via bar graph on every spectrum.
                Additionally, all spectra will be curated with a <em>Clean</em> or <em>Noisy</em> feedback based on the curated spectral
                and normalized entropy. To learn more about spectral and normalized entropy, click <a [routerLink]="['/documentation/entropy']">here</a>.
