Frontend:
    - Tag sizes in additional tags search
    - Similar spectra opens new tab
    - Changing email in 'edit user' admin page creates a new submitter, but not a new user, can't log in with updated email

    - Sort spectra by score maybe? When searching

Backend:
    - Debug the random error I had when starting out where it said there were 0 spectra and search wouldn't work
        - Happens if you connect to the IP? Instead of the URL, nope
        - Nope, happened again randomly 8/27, still going on 9/5

        - AKA static_download in the db, table is empty on prod, fixed length display issue
        - Make additional downloads on Download page a clickable dropdown (frontend)
    - Links to "Originally submitted to..." like eu MassBank shows error404 page not found
        - Just old libraries whose links are outdated?
    - Are relative_score and scaled_score useless in the score db table? All values are set to 0
    - Error in downloader service 2025-09-06, empty string. Failed the 'All Spectra' download
        - Error logs in YouTrack
