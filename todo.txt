Frontend:
    - Search icons next to:
        - Spectra attributes on browse page
        - Compound metadata in display full record
        - Submitter High Scores names on homepage
        - Compound Classification hierarchy 
        - Admin page of submitters next to first name
    - Hover turns to click cursor over "Similar Spectra" when in display full record mode
    - Have library selection be a dropdown of checkboxes to minimize space taken up (on search page)
    - Have tags be formatted better on search page, in rows instead of one column, and make clickable boxes instead of pop up on click
        - Add legend to describe colors of tags (green = has tag, red = does not have, blank = unselected)
        - Do not make Add Additional Tags to Query a clickable name, turn into a header style font
        - Currently sorted by number of spectra associated, which is good
        - Allow for search? 
    - Reformat similarity search instructions: "Supports spectra in the single-line format... etc."
        - Same for the upload page
    - Add "Supports MSP, MGF and MassBank Records Format (.txt) mass spectral data files" to parenthesis after "Upload a file"
    - Similarity search page: change "Load Spectrum" button to "Similarity Search"
    - Think about changing the yellow grayed out "Searching...." page/animation
    - Create new query / Add to query button box is formatted incorrectly for the spectra attributes when browsing for example
        - Change the highlight color, it's too dark
        - Also same formatting issue on the compound metadata parts
    - Make folder icons show clickable on hover in Download page
    - What is "Additional Downloads" used for? It's empty on prod
    - Database Index & Statistic page
        - "Database Content" box is chopped
        - Metadata pie chart shows decimals for spectral count
        - Ionization mode for pie chart goes out of bounds
        - Change the "MS Level, Ion Mode, Precursor Type" Dropdown to a cleaner 3 box selection
        - Change "Database Content" "Metadata" and "Compound Classes" headers to be more visible and defined
        - Have Spectrum vs Compound count be highlighted based on current selection
        - Search icon Query button doesn't highlight on hover (compound classes page)
        - Remove outline box from all three subtabs, looks weird
        - MS5 is too similar to MS2 in color
        - Duplicate Ionization modes on pie chart? (3 positive, 2 negative types)
        - Are M-H and [M-H]- the same precursor type? Merge them maybe?
        - Make the Database Content table more compact, numbers are too far apart from their attributes
    - Reformat the "Please log in before uploading spectra" box to be smaller, adjust message below it
    - Make the display hidden downloads checkbox highlight blue instead of current green (Downloads page)
    - Change search checkboxes to more clickable buttons
    - Move the "Create New Library" info icon one space to the right (advanced uploader page)
        - "Select a file clean" ? Does it mean upload file
    - Make folder names bolded in Download page
    - Why are download buttons on Download page not aligned?
    - How is the submitter high scores table calculated? Needs to be adjusted
    - "Click to see the explanation for the 5.00/5 score" - remove decimals
        - Just realized we can have half stars, so maybe try to have them be visualized too, but that explains the decimals
        - Same with "Explanation for the 5.00 / 5 star score"
        - Also add a space for the info icon to breathe
    - (provided by ClassyFire) info icon should not be clicked by default
    - Remove the "Click here to learn more the changes to the query system popup"
    - How are "Top Rated Spectral Records" being displayed? Like which are chosen to be shown (homepage)
    - Admin page Filter query term formatting

Backend:
    - What is "Additional Downloads" used for? It's empty on prod
    - Debug the random error I had when starting out where it said there were 0 spectra and search wouldn't work
    - What does "Add to Query" vs "Create New Query" do?
    - What are "hidden downloads" like on the downloads page?
    - Duplicate Ionization modes on pie chart? (3 positive, 2 negative types)
    - Are M-H and [M-H]- the same precursor type? Merge them maybe?
    - Links to "Originally submitted to..." like eu massbank shows error404 page not found
    - Can't see users' uploaded spectra on admin page?
    - Manage submitters page does not load when refreshed
    - User profile page fails when refreshed
    
Fixed: 
    - Display full record button does not open a new page like it says it will - should be fixed
    - Right caret on buttons like dipeptide_neg - should be fixed
    - Space between comment bubbles on "Review Spectrum Quality" - should be fixed
    - Download button size on single spectra
    - Search icons next to:
        - Submitter name on a display full record - should be fixed
        - Mass spectral metadata in display full record - should be fixed
    - Typo in "Upload an spectral library file and dynamically modify the mass spectra and metadata" - fixed
    - Submitter high scores now ordered by count with minimum avg score of 3
    - Admin manage submitters page cleaned up
