Frontend:
    - Allow for half-scores to be visualized by the star rating system
        - Can do it with custom ng template on the ngbrating bootstrap component, use fa icons
    - Reorganize the spectra full view so that all dropdowns are under "compound information"
        - Give the spectra metadata its own dropdown too
    - Database Index & Statistic page
        - Metadata pie chart shows decimals for spectral count
        - MS5 color in the legend is too similar to MS2
            - Not hardcoded, part of db3 colors?
        - Duplicate Ionization modes on pie chart? (3 positive, 2 negative types)
        - Are M-H and [M-H]- the same precursor type? Merge them maybe?
    - Changing email in 'edit user' admin page creates a new submitter, but not a new user, can't log in with updated email
    - Forgot Username / Password feature

Backend:
    - Updating a user's email doesn't work
        - Creates a new submitter that can't log in with that new email (fails to create a new user)
    - Can't upload to dev or prod?
    - What is "Additional Downloads" and what are they used for? It's empty on prod
        - AKA static_download in the db, table is empty on prod, fixed length display issue
        - Make additional downloads on Download page a clickable dropdown (frontend)
    - What are "hidden downloads" like on the downloads page? There are none shown on prod?
        - On dev they show libraries with 0 entries?
    - Debug the random error I had when starting out where it said there were 0 spectra and search wouldn't work
        - Happens if you connect to the IP? Instead of the URL, nope
        - Nope, happened again randomly 8/27, still going on 9/3
    - Duplicate Ionization modes on pie chart? (3 positive, 2 negative types)
        - Remove case sensitivity from categories in spectra-database-index.component.ts, getMetadataValues() line 132
    - Are M-H and [M-H]- the same precursor type? Merge them maybe?
    - Links to "Originally submitted to..." like eu MassBank shows error404 page not found
    - Are relative and scaled _score useless in the score db table? All values are set to 0

Done:
    - Display full record button does not open a new page like it says it will - should be fixed
    - Right caret on buttons like dipeptide_neg - should be fixed
    - Space between comment bubbles on "Review Spectrum Quality" - should be fixed
    - Download button size on single spectra
    - Search icons next to:
        - Submitter name on a display full record - should be fixed
        - Mass spectral metadata in display full record - should be fixed
    - Typo in "Upload an spectral library file and dynamically modify the mass spectra and metadata"
    - How is the submitter high scores table calculated? Needs to be adjusted
        - Submitter high scores now ordered by count with minimum avg score of 3

        - Change "Database Content" "Metadata" and "Compound Classes" headers to be more visible and defined

            - Next to submitter name on "display full record"
    - Create new query / Add to query button box is formatted incorrectly for the spectra attributes when browsing for example
        - Change the highlight color, it's too dark
